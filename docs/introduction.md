# Introduction

[Wasmtime][github], a [Bytecode Alliance][BA] project, is used to run
[Webassembly][Wasm] (Wasm) programs [without a web browser].  
Typically, an application calls Wasmtime to load and run Wasm
modules. Or, the Wasmtime command line utility can run standalone Wasm
programs.

[Webassembly][Wasm] (Wasm) is an assembly language for a [virtual
stack machine][VSM] running inside an application.  High-level
languages must be compiled to Wasm prior to loading. Upon loading,
Wasmtime compiles Wasm to native machine code.

[WebAssembly System Interface][WASI] (WASI) provides a library of
essential functions, such as reading files, somewhat similar libc.

Wasmtime strives to be a highly configurable and embeddable runtime to run on
any scale of application. Many features are still under development so if you
have a question don't hesitate to [file an issue][issue].

This guide is intended to server a number of purposes and within you'll find:

* [How to create simple wasm modules](tutorial-create-hello-world.md)
* [How to use Wasmtime from a number of languages](lang.md)
* [How to use install and use the `wasmtime` CLI](cli.md)
* Information about [stability](stability.md) and [security](security.md) in
  Wasmtime.
